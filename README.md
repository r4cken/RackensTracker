# RackensTracker
RackensTracker keeps track of all your characters currencies, raid and dungeon lockouts including the weekly and daily reset across all realms you play on. 

The tracking window displays several relevant sections such as warband data, realm data, character data, lockout and currencies and each section is customizable allowing you to view what is most relevant for you.
